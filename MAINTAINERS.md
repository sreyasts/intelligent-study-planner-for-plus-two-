2. **Pull Request Review**: Every pull request that passes automated CI tests (`npm test`, `npm run test:legacy`, `npm run lint`) will receive actionable architectural review or approval within **48 hours**.

## 🛡️ Core Maintainer Invariants

The maintainer commits to upholding the following architectural and ethical invariants:

1. **Zero Synthetic Signals**: Zero fake, purchased, or swapped stars, forks, automated traffic, bot accounts, or synthetic reviews. If an issue or PR is authored by the maintainer, it is explicitly tagged `maintainer-authored`.
2. **Deterministic Scheduling Engine**: Study timetable allocations are deterministic, reproducible, and verifiable. PRs affecting the core engine (`src/engine/planner.js` or `src/core/scheduler.js`) must pass all 551 legacy invariant checks and Vitest test suites.
3. **Student Privacy First**: Mission PlusTwo operates by default in 100% offline Guest Mode with zero Personally Identifiable Information (PII) collection. Any cloud sync features must strictly require affirmative parent/guardian consent under India's Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act 2023.
4. **Kerala DHSE / SCERT Canon**: All chapter listings, mark weights, and part splits must strictly reflect the official Kerala State Board SCERT Scheme of Work.
5. **Dual-Domain Production Continuity**: Every release must deploy cleanly across both primary hosting ([`mission-plustwo.web.app`](https://mission-plustwo.web.app/)) and GitHub Pages mirror.
