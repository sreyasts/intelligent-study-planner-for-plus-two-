## [1.1.0] - 2026-09-24

### Added
- **Decoupled Core Scheduling Engine (`src/core/`)**:
  - Extracted framework-agnostic pure logic module into `src/core/scheduler.js` with deterministic `generateSchedule({ stream, examDate, subjects, hoursPerDay, focusAreas })` API.
  - Added discrete active recall allocation (`allocateActiveRecall`) and invariant schedule validator (`validateSchedule`).
  - Implemented 100% backward compatibility bridge in `src/engine/planner.js` ensuring existing web UI and legacy tests pass unconditionally.
- **Machine-Readable Open Curriculum Schemas (`schemas/` and `data/kerala-dhse/`)**:
  - `schemas/curriculum.schema.json`: Rigid Draft-07 JSON Schema strictly validating `subjectId`, `subjectName`, `stream`, and `chapters` (with `chapterNumber`, `title`, `weightageScore`, and `recommendedRevisionHours`).
  - `data/kerala-dhse/science.json`: Formalized DHSE Science stream curriculum (Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics, Botany, Zoology, Computer Science).
  - `data/kerala-dhse/commerce.json`: Formalized DHSE Commerce stream curriculum (Accountancy, Business Studies, Economics, Computer Applications).
  - `data/kerala-dhse/humanities.json`: Formalized DHSE Humanities stream curriculum (History, Political Science, Sociology, Economics).
- **Automated Verification & CI Upgrades**:
  - `tests/scheduler.test.js`: Comprehensive test suite testing short revision runways (7 days), standard multi-month schedules (120 days), single-subject intensive courses, and malformed inputs/boundary conditions.
  - `tests/curriculum-schema.test.js`: Automated Ajv schema test verifying all curriculum JSON files against `curriculum.schema.json`.
  - Upgraded `.github/workflows/ci.yml` with ESLint, Vitest, schema validation, legacy invariant tests, and Vite production bundle checks.
- **Community & Governance Infrastructure**:
  - Standard Contributor Covenant v2.1 in `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`.
  - Comprehensive `CONTRIBUTING.md` with Conventional Commits and branch workflow specifications.
  - `SECURITY.md` covering responsible disclosure, SLA, and DPDP Act 2023 minor data protection.
  - Structured issue templates (`bug_report.md`, `syllabus_update.md`, `feature_request.md`) and `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`.
