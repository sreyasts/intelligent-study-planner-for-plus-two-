# Changelog

All notable changes to **HSS Planner** will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

---

## [7.1.1] - 2026-11-02

### Fixed
- Allow the app's class and session fields through owner-only Firestore validation so plans and progress actually upload.
- Persist pending changes per account, retry failed saves after reconnect/reload, and report cloud failures instead of claiming success.
- Reconcile concurrent task edits transactionally, preserve intentional unticks and immutable account fields, and ask before replacing a different plan.
- Cover phone/PC recovery with browser tests and validate permitted and denied operations against the Firestore emulator in CI.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- Restore +1 Improvement subject/date selection, accept improvement-only backups, and keep improvement-only regeneration and migration free of unrelated +2 lessons.
- Save task completion, undo, XP and streak changes before showing success. Failed local writes retain previous progress, roll back both saved plan keys, and show a retry/backup message without uploading the unsaved change.

## [6.4.3] - 2026-10-18

### Fixed
- Refresh Today's timetable at local midnight and immediately on returning to the app, including brief screen locks across midnight.
- Validate backup size, dates, tasks and identifiers before restoring; ask before replacing progress, retain the current plan on cancellation, and roll back local writes on storage failures.
- Omit account identity fields from portable backups and record the current app version.

### Changed
- Keep public documentation focused on student workflows and maintenance. Add a voluntary study-session testing guide and feedback template.
- Link the stats page to current CI results rather than a stale fixed test count.

## [6.4.2] - 2026-10-16

### Changed
- Remove the focus timer, floating overlay, picture-in-picture windows and completion popups entirely.
- Replace oversized focus cards and badges with compact daily task rows, clear completion/undo controls and expandable study resources.
- Keep calendar-based Today, previous pending work and tomorrow's preview separate. Preserve saved plans and AI study tutor links.

## [6.4.1] - 2026-10-16

### Changed
- Today follows the local calendar. Yesterday and older pending tasks stay in a separate completion list, with a read-only tomorrow preview. Finishing a day no longer opens a future day's timetable. Open sections survive background redraws.
- Put today's study progress and next task ahead of badges and secondary tools. Print, sharing and reset remain under Plan tools.
- Show daily capacity before plan creation, keep one start button, and support keyboard stream selection. Replace fixed clock suggestions with numbered study blocks.
- Remove automatic sign-in interruptions after guest plan creation and recovery. Refresh the offline cache version.
- Precache built JavaScript and CSS and match invariant bundles across Origin variations so a first-visit offline reload restores the interactive app. Label future study days accurately after automatic advancement.
- Correct unsupported adoption/compliance claims and stale public metrics. The stats page reads the current plan storage key and renders the stream as text.
- Exercise guest setup, task completion and persistence at mobile and desktop widths. Use Node 24 and strict lockfile installation in CI.
