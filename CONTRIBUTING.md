# Contributing to Mission PlusTwo

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **Mission PlusTwo**! This open-source project provides a free, deterministic, privacy-first study planning and timetable generation platform for students taking the Kerala Directorate of Higher Secondary Education (DHSE) examinations.

Whether you are a student correcting a syllabus typo, a teacher refining difficulty weightings, a translator polishing Malayalam phrasing, or an engineer improving our scheduling engine, your contribution is deeply appreciated.

## 2. Ways to Contribute

You do not need to be an expert programmer to make high-impact contributions:

1. **Syllabus & Curriculum Corrections** (`good first issue`):
   - Kerala SCERT/DHSE periodically updates chapter rationalizations and exam schemes of work. Help us ensure all chapter names, textbook unit numbers, and marks allocations match official state board notifications.
   - Reference: [How to Update Syllabus Data](docs/how-to-update-syllabus.md).
2. **Malayalam Translations** (`good first issue`):
   - Help translate and refine student-facing guidance, tips, and chapter titles into natural, accessible Malayalam.
   - Reference: [Malayalam Translation Guide](docs/TRANSLATION-GUIDE.md).
3. **Accessibility & Responsive UI** (`good first issue`):
   - Test the planner on entry-level Android devices, screen readers, and low-contrast mobile environments.
   - Reference: [Accessibility Standards](docs/ACCESSIBILITY-GUIDE.md).
4. **Planning Engine & Heuristics**:
   - Improve the greedy constraint-propagation algorithm in `src/engine/planner.js`, handle tricky holiday runways, or optimize benchmark variance.
5. **Documentation & Student Guides**:
   - Write clear, practical revision and exam preparation guides for Plus Two students.
