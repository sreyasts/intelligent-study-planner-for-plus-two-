## 3. Persistent Decisions Log

*Entries added dynamically when owner input is provided.*

- **2026-09-23**: Integrity Invariant confirmed — zero fake traffic, zero fake stars, zero fake testimonials. All benchmarks and reports strictly grounded in real metrics.
- **2026-09-23**: Primary canonical host remains `https://mission-plustwo.web.app/`.
- **2026-09-24**: Product Identity & Target Audience — Do NOT promote CBSE. Mission PlusTwo's primary product identity, branding, onboarding streams, and distribution channels remain strictly focused on Kerala DHSE Higher Secondary (+2 Science, Commerce, Humanities, and +1 Improvement). Any secondary curriculum adapters remain strictly architectural/developer-facing, never promoted in the student UI or user-facing product pages.
- **2026-09-24**: Pragmatic Roadmap Discipline — No speculative or hyped roadmap items (e.g., Malayalam Voice Assistant, WebRTC collaborative peer study sprints, teacher batch export). Maintain a strictly grounded, honest, and realistic roadmap reflecting only features the maintainer actually plans to build and support (deterministic planning, model exam simulations, spaced recall flashcards, accessibility, DHSE syllabus updates).
- **2026-09-24**: Single Unified Logo & Search Optimization — Strict requirement to use one single canonical logo (`icon.png`) across all application headers, PWA icons, favicons, GitHub README, Google Search schema/OpenGraph, and social previews. Comprehensive keyword coverage for high-intent search terms ('plus two', '12th', 'plustwo plan', 'plustwo planner', 'plustwo timetable', 'kerala plus two timetable') with authentic UI screenshots and promotional assets.
- **2026-09-24**: Minor Data Consent Architecture (DPDP Act 2023) — Option A selected: Default to 100% Guest Mode (offline `localStorage`, zero PII); enforce explicit affirmative parental/guardian consent confirmation gate (`#auth-consent-checkbox`) for minors under 18 prior to Google OAuth cloud synchronization.
- **2026-09-24**: Telemetry & Cookie Policy — Option A selected: Full cookie and pseudonymous identifier transparency in Privacy Policy with lazy loading, strict PII masking (`allow_google_signals: false`, `allow_ad_personalization_signals: false`), and in-app privacy documentation.
- **2026-09-24**: Strategic Plan Execution Approved — Full authorization granted to execute all phases (Truth Pass, Real Usage Measurement, Distribution Kit, Maintainer Infrastructure, and Codex Application Readiness Scorecard held in draft).
