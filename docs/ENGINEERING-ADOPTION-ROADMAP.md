## Part 2: Adoption, Distribution & Community Roadmap

### Channel 1: The Teacher & School Grassroots On-Ramp
*Kerala higher secondary teachers (HSST) are the single most influential advocates for academic study tools.*

- **Actionable Steps**:
  1. Distribute the free, non-commercial teacher toolkit (`docs/distribution-growth-kit.md`) to Higher Secondary School Teachers' associations across all 14 districts of Kerala.
  2. Provide printable, high-resolution wall posters (`dist/assets/printable-timetable-qr.pdf`) for school notice boards and staff rooms with embedded vector QR codes linking to [`https://mission-plustwo.web.app/`](https://mission-plustwo.web.app/).
  3. Conduct informational workshops for Career Guidance & Adolescent Counselling Cell (CG&ACC) coordinators in government schools.

---

### Channel 2: Peer-to-Peer Study Group Network Effects
*Students study in decentralized WhatsApp and Telegram groups.*

- **Actionable Steps**:
  1. Optimize the 1-click Web Share card: When a student finishes their daily study quota, a single tap generates a clean, non-spammy summary card:
     ```
     📚 Mission PlusTwo Study Check-in:
     ✅ Covered: Electric Charges & Fields (Part 2)
     🎯 Next: Electrostatic Potential
     ⏳ 132 days until DHSE Board Exam
     Plan your timetable: https://mission-plustwo.web.app/
     ```
  2. Distribute high-yield study resources (SCERT rationalized chapter checklists) on educational Telegram channels (HSSLive, Plus Two Science Kerala, Bio-Vision).

---

### Channel 3: Search Engine Acquisition (Organic Inbound)
*Students search for exam schedules, syllabus breakdowns, and revision timetables.*

  - *Query*: "Plus two exam countdown live" &rarr; Land on [`/pages/exam-countdown.html`](https://mission-plustwo.web.app/exam-countdown)
  - *Query*: "Class 12 backlog recovery study plan" &rarr; Land on [`/pages/backlog-recovery-planner.html`](https://mission-plustwo.web.app/backlog-recovery-planner)
  - *Query*: "Plus two daily study hours calculator" &rarr; Land on [`/pages/study-hours-calculator.html`](https://mission-plustwo.web.app/study-hours-calculator)
  - *Query*: "+1 improvement exam date & study schedule" &rarr; Land on [`/pages/plus-one-improvement-guide.html`](https://mission-plustwo.web.app/plus-one-improvement-guide)
- **Technical SEO Hygiene**:
  - 100% valid Schema.org `WebApplication` and `FAQPage` JSON-LD markup.
